## Algorithms for graph learning

In this repository, I intend to provide python implementations of graph learning algorithms that I have used successfully to construct graphs from data for the tasks described in the following papers, which I have (co)authored:

1. **Block-based spectral image reconstruction using smoothness on graphs (2022).**
2. **Graph learning based on signal smoothness representation for homogeneous and heterogenous change detection (2022).**

Particularly, this first version of the repo includes the graph learning model developed by Vassilis Kalofolias et al. in the papers:

** How to learn a graph from smooth signals (2016), and large scale graph learning from smooth signals (2017).**

I will however update the repo with new models not yet implemented in python and some of my own models.
